\section{Objective}      
The object of this document is to completely specify the operational mode of the SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS).  

It is the conviction of the participants that SNEWS should operate under conditions that are
\begin{itemize}
\item Documented and available at all times to the participants
\item Approved by the participants
\item Consistent with the objectives of SNEWS, those being
\begin{itemize}
\item Prompt
\item the other P's including a statement about false alarm rates
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

One caveat is that details that would assist individuals in locating and gaining access to the SNEWS servers, and information that could be used to simulate SNEWS alerts, will be confined to an Appendix which will not be widely distributed but is nonetheless available to certain members of the participating experiments.

It is also implicit that SNEWS will develop in a series of managed transitions between operational modes. Each operational mode will be identified by a number and the date when it came into effect.   More….

\section{Operational Mode \#1 effective 1/11/2003}

\subsection{The participants}
	(Here are listed all experiments that may presently send alerts to the coincidence server(s).  It is understood that a temporary lack of participation of one or more or these listed experiments for hours, days, or weeks does not constitute a change of operational mode.  Any other change in this list does constitute a change of Operational Mode.)
\begin{itemize}
\item S-K
\item LVD
\item SNO
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Client Computer Management}


\subsection{Server Computer Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item account management / password management
\item generic access guidelines
\item physical security
\item network security
\item OS maintenance schedule
\item Etc. etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Client-Server Communications}
\begin{itemize}
\item definition of test, silver, and gold (experiment) alerts
\item generic description of security measures / encryption 
\end{itemize}
